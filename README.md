NOTA BENE:

    The project's server was NOT made in GOLANG, but in NODE-EXPRESS.
    I just couldn't get around learning GOLANG, working from home and having a headache every single hour,
    so i took the decision to try improve my JS skills ( as i'll be needing that for the 6 month project which i'll be doing in JS ).
    I'm prepared to assume the consequences of my choice.
